# Convolutional-Neural-Network-Example
A simple CNN that can decide whether a picture is of a cat or a dog.

run data.py to build and save the data to training_data.npy.

nn.py creates and trains the neural network. 

model.log saves specific in and out of sample accuracy and loss to then be graphed and compared.
